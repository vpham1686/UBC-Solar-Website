                                        I am a fourth-year ECE student who has a focus on firmware.
                                        I joined UBC Solar in my first year at UBC and have found it tremendously important for my career growth.
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        In my first year, I joined as a member of the software team.
                                        When I first joined, I worked on firmware projects including cruise control and regen braking for the car.
                                        I eventually started getting more involved with the electrical side of the team and worked on more general electrical projects.
                                        At the start of my second year, I became the electrical lead for the team.
                                        As the electrical lead, my role mainly focuses on supporting the electrical teams.
                                        I spend a lot of my time training new members and assisting in technical projects.
                                        Another aspect is working with sponsors to get the tools to build the car effectively.

                                        Solar has been a formative part of my university experience since I joined in 2019 and has taught me much about leadership, project management, and mechanical and automotive design.

                                        The mechanical team consists of the aeroshell, chassis, battery, and vehicle dynamics teams.
                                        We work together to design and build all the physical components of the car so that it's safe, reliable, and performs well.
                                        The mechanical lead is mainly responsible for coordinating the efforts of the mechanical teams so that their systems integrate seamlessly and don't interfere with each other or any of the electrical teams.

                                        I am in my third year of engineering at UBC, specializing in environmental engineering.
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        I have always had a passion and saw value for integrating business and engineering together.
                                        Behind every great engineering team are the finances to back up the cutting edge innovation.
                                        The business team works on website software, team finances, sponsorship relations, social media management, and community engagement.
                                        The business team is vital to the team's success, as we need to finance solar electric cars costing ~$150,000!
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        As the business team lead, I handle some team logistics and manage the business team projects.
                                        UBC Solar has changed my life as I have learnt technical skills, management techniques, and made many lifelong friends on the design team.

                                        Ever since my first Javascript program back in 2015, I've loved the idea of using software to solve difficult problems.
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        Having been a member since 2019, I can tell you that being part of the software team here at Solar means working on projects that involve a vast breadth of engineering and computing concepts far outside what is taught in the classroom in an environment that strongly encourages creativity and innovation.
                                        Our work not only involves developing software that goes straight into the safety-critical control systems in our car but also software that extracts runtime information from our car and builds data-driven strategies from it.
                                        <br></br><br></br>
                                        Outside of Solar, you'll usually find me perfecting my jump-shot or losing skin at my local bouldering gym.

                                        The Vehicle Dynamics sub-team is responsible for the handling performance of the car.
                                        Our members work hard to optimize the suspension, steering, wheels, and brake systems, ensuring the vehicle is safe to drive at speed!

                                        In my spare time, you can find me biking and hiking the mountains in Coquitlam or working on developing my own DIY ebike.

                                        I can say that my knowledge with 3 years into mechanical engineering and joining the team in 2019 my engineering skills that the fewer moving parts, the better the chassis FEA.
                                        Our work does not only involve the structural integrity of the car but also the seamless integration of all the components of the car such as the aeroshell and steering system of the car.
                                        If I'm not working on the car I'm probably designing robots or in the gym.

                                        As the chassis subteam lead, I work on the core structure of the solar car, use FEA to ensure its structural integrity and produce a high factor of safety.
                                        I also understand other components of the car, such as the aeroshell and steering system, and seamlessly integrate these with the chassis.

                                    I am third-year mechanical engineering student and co-lead of the Battery team focusing on the mechanical side of the battery. 
                                    Starting out at Solar on the Aeroshell team, I learned about composite materials and aerodynamics. 
                                    Eager to learn more about the integration of mechanical and electrical systems, I made the change to the Battery team.

                                    Members of the Battery team can expect to develop a large knowledgebase working on projects ranging from designing temperature sensing PCBs in Altium to manufacturing a composite battery enclosure. 
                                    Together the Battery sub-team is responsible for keeping the heart of the car up and running safely.

                                        The Battery sub-team is responsible for the safe operation of the car's lithium-ion battery pack.
                                        Our members ensure our battery can charge safely, and is at an optimal temperature, state of charge, and voltage to keep the rest of the car's electrical systems - from turn signals to main motor - running smoothly.
                                        Our team members come from diverse technical backgrounds, and tackle projects such as fault-detection firmware, current-sensing PCB design, and mechanical integration of the battery pack with the rest of the car.

                                        Namely the driver interface, vehicle manoeuvring, lights, navigation, communication and data logging.
                                        Our team primarily designs, assembles and tests boards, as well as the wiring of these modules.
